## Purpose and Outcome of the course 

Within the scope of the Web Programming course, all the information required to create a web page will be given at a basic level. A student who successfully completes this course will be able to:

* Master basic HTML commands.
* Shape web pages with basic CSS commands.
* Have knowledge of basic Javascript commands.
* Design a simple web page from scratch, place tables, images, videos, music on this web page, make visual arrangements and develop simple interactive applications on the created web page.

## The Three Musketeers of Web Programming: HTML5, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

Web pages and web applications are generally created by combining three components.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align= "center", fig.cap="HTML, CSS, and JS are three main components of a web page"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/00--GeneralInfo/html css js.png")
```

* **HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language):** It allows the content of web pages and web applications to be arranged within a certain logical framework. In this section, the designer deals with the text itself, section headings, shapes, lists, etc.
* **CSS (Cascading style sheets):** This is the part that deals with the presentation, style and visuals of the web page. CSS allows the text prepared with HTML5 to be placed in a template. The parts that CSS deals with are font, font size, font color, page margins, etc.
* **JS (JavaScript):** Allows a web page to interact with the user. Prevents the web page from being just a text. Allows a web application to be created from the web page.
