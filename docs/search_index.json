The motivation behind this book is to provide a comprehensive and easy to understand lecture notes in a tidy way. 0.1 About the Author I am Erhan Cene, working as an associate professor at the Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey in the department of statistics (see university webpage). My broad research interest is on data science and statistical programming especially (but not limited to) in sports analytics and biostatistics (see publication list). I mostly give programming courses such as Introduction to Python, Statistical Programming with R, Database and Web Programming along with the Sampling 1 course at the undergraduate level and Data Manipulation and Visualisation course at the graduate level.

A student who successfully completes this course will be able to: Master basic HTML commands. Shape web pages with basic CSS commands. Have knowledge of basic Javascript commands. Design a simple web page from scratch, place tables, images, videos, music on this web page, make visual arrangements and develop simple interactive applications on the created web page. 0.3 The Three Musketeers of Web Programming: HTML5, CSS and JAVASCRIPT Web pages and web applications are generally created by combining three components. Figure 0.1: HTML, CSS, and JS are three main components of a web page HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language): It allows the content of web pages and web applications to be arranged within a certain logical framework. In this section, the designer deals with the text itself, section headings, shapes, lists, etc. CSS (Cascading style sheets): This is the part that deals with the presentation, style and visuals of the web page. CSS allows the text prepared with HTML5 to be placed in a template. The parts that CSS deals with are font, font size, font color, page margins, etc. JS (JavaScript): Allows a web page to interact with the user. Prevents the web page from being just a text. Allows a web application to be created from the web page. 0.4 Possible tools that can be used to code HTML5, CSS and JavaScript JS Bin: Main Page CodePen: Main Page Visual Studio Code: Main Page Notepad++: Main Page Some web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari etc. 0.5 Some helpful websites to be used while learning HTML5, CSS and JavaScript Mozilla Developer Network (MDN): Main Page W3 Schools Main Page Codeacademy Documents Main Page 0.6 Weekly Draft Course Plan Draft means that dates and contents may change based on the conditions.

"],["html.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to HTML 1.1 What is HTML for? 1.2 Page Structure of HTML", " Chapter 1 Introduction to HTML This chapter will teach the basics of HTML. 1.1 What is HTML for? HTML5 is the abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language. It defines the structure of a web page. It consists of a series of elements defined by specific commands. Each command expresses a different structure of the text. These elements specify how the web browser should display the web page. HTML elements are shown with labels called tags. HTML tags allow the text to be separated into headings, paragraphs, tables, figures, web links, etc. and for the browser to perceive this separation. Web pages do not display HTML tags on their pages, but they use them to create the page. 1.2 Page Structure of HTML Each HTML code consists of a heading defined by the &lt;head&gt; tag and a body defined by the &lt;body&gt; tag. The &lt;head&gt; tag contains header information about the HTML being created. Header information refers to information such as heading, character set, etc. The &lt;body&gt; tag is the main text section containing other tags. This section includes section headings, lists, tables, images, website links, etc. A comment is given between &lt;!‐‐ comment comes here ‐‐&gt; .
